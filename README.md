![hallvr1](/screenshots/thehall1.jpg)


The museum is a demo created in A-frame to test the WebVR capabilities.

The project has a variety of art items in display. Some custom, some of free access and use.


# Navigation

In this version, the main navigation is hand controls (Vive wands and Oculus Touch) to fire a teleporting ray to target where you want to be at.

For desktop the traditional gaming controls are available (WASD, arrow keys and mouse).

For mobile platforms (GearVR and Cardboard) Teleport Spots with a Gaze cursor are the way to jump to the several targets placed in the hall.
